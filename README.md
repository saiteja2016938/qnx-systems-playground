My journey into QNX real-time programming — from simple IPC demos to complete software-only real-time systems.


# QNX System Playground – Client-Server and other Project

## About Project
This project demonstrates my learning and practice of "QNX Neutrino IPC (Inter-Process Communication)" using the Momentics IDE.  

I created my own working environment with all the necessary requirements to successfully run "Client-Server communication code".  

The key things I achieved:
- Built my own project environment from scratch.  
- Created all required "Makefile, build files, and header files".  
- Automated the building and running process using the Makefile.  
- Understood the flow of execution between server and client programs.  
- Successfully rebuilt and executed the server and client code so that they communicate with each other.  

## Proof of Work
Below are screenshots from my environment showing the project setup and execution:
